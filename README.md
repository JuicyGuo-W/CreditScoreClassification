## Project Intro
Project Goal: This project aims to use credit-related information and other banking details to predict and classify an individualâ€™s credit score bracket.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification/data (train.csv)

## Required Packages
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- category_encoders
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost
- Tensorflow
- Keras

## Files
- CreditData/train.csv: Download the train.csv from the Kaggle link above, placing it in a folder called CreditData, where CreditData is in the same directory as the Python Notebooks.
- FinalProject.ipynb: Notebook containing data processing, visualization, and machine learning models.
- FinalProject.pdf: Exported FinalProject.ipynb as a PDF file.
- FinalReport.pdf: 3-page report 

## Execution Instructions
Ensure the dataset is properly downloaded and placed in the correct directory. Then, execute the Python notebook from start to end. 

## ML Models
